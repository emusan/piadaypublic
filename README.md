#Pi a day code!

[Pi a day](http://piaday.herokuapp.com) was a small project I came up with in order to facilitate my learning of the rails web framework over a summer.

The code is pretty basic, and probably pretty poor, but it does get the job done (for the most part), and I do hope that by releasing it as open source it does help someone!

Much of the code in this is borrowed from examples in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) and [rails casts](http://railscasts.com/), among other great tutorials and sites, I highly recommend you check them all out!

I should note that I have not yet written tests for this, I know I should have and perhaps at some point I will, though this is still a relatively small project and testing things myself worked so far.

If this code does help you in any way please let me know (it would surprise me to a degree lol).

I am considering this a completed project at this point, if you have code suggestions please let me know, though don't expect me to rewrite large portions of this, it was a fun project but now it's done as far as I'm concerned.
If you would like to submit your own code/improvements by all means submit a pull request and if I deem it "worthy" it will be added!

If you wish to praise me for my amazing coding skills, or give me a job, my contact info can be found on [my site](http://www.somestupidwebsite.com/email).

If you wish to yell at me for this horrid mess of "code," I'm sorry but there is no way to contact me at all... (constructive criticism is always welcome though, and the link above will still work for you)
